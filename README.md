# RUNNING TEST DATA

Model has been uploaded to canvas. Download the model and place in the same directory as notebook. The name of our folder is already hard-coded into the variable "weights". Into the variables "test_data" and "test_labels" write the appropriate file path.

To run the test data, only run the cells that are under "TEST SECTION" directly below "FULL TRAINING". The evaluation will take care of itself.
